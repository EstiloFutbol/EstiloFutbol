# API Documentation

## Overview

The Estilo Futbol API provides access to football data from StatsBomb. This document outlines the available endpoints, their parameters, and response formats.

## Base URL

When running locally, the API is available at:

```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

When deployed to Vercel, the API is available at:

```
https://estilo-futbol.vercel.app/api
```

üåê **Live API**: [https://estilo-futbol.vercel.app/api](https://estilo-futbol.vercel.app/api)

**Interactive API Documentation**: [https://estilo-futbol.vercel.app/api/docs](https://estilo-futbol.vercel.app/api/docs)

## Authentication

The API now supports two authentication methods to secure access to football data:

### 1. API Key Authentication

For programmatic access, use an API key in the request header:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here" http://localhost:8000/api/competitions/
```

**PowerShell Example:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/competitions/" -Headers @{"X-API-Key"="your-api-key-here"}
```

### 2. JWT Token Authentication

For user-based authentication, obtain a JWT token by logging in:

#### Login

```
POST /auth/login
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

#### Using JWT Token

Include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here" http://localhost:8000/api/competitions/
```

**PowerShell Example:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/competitions/" -Headers @{"Authorization"="Bearer your-jwt-token-here"}
```

### Configuration

Authentication is configured via environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: The API key for programmatic access
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT signing secret
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: Admin username for login
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin password for login

### Security Features

- JWT tokens expire after 30 minutes
- CORS is configured to allow specific origins
- All protected endpoints require either valid API key or JWT token
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

**Note:** The API is prepared for future integration with StatsBomb's private API, which will require additional authentication configuration.

## Endpoints

### Health Check

#### Ping

```
GET /ping
```

A simple health check endpoint to verify the API is running.

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### Competitions

The competitions endpoints use `statsbombpy.competitions()` to fetch data from StatsBomb's open data repository.

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or missing required parameters
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found

## Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no rate limits implemented. However, please be considerate with your API usage.

## Future Endpoints

The following endpoints are planned for future releases:

- `/teams/`: Get team information and statistics
- `/players/`: Get player information and statistics
- `/events/`: Get detailed event data for matches

## Switching to StatsBomb Private API

The API is designed to be easily switched from StatsBomb's open data to their private API. When this switch occurs, the endpoints will remain the same, but authentication will be required.

To use the private API, you will need to:

1. Obtain API credentials from StatsBomb
2. Set the following environment variables:
   - `STATSBOMB_USE_PRIVATE_API=true`
   - `STATSBOMB_API_KEY=your_api_key`
   - `STATSBOMB_API_URL=private_api_url`

No changes to your client code will be necessary as the API interface will remain consistent.
